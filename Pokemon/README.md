# This project is a mini Pokemon game:
-This game chooses a random monster and assigns a random combat power to it.
-The user gets 5 attempts to catch the Pokemon.
-The probability of the user catching the Pokemon depends on how low the combat power is, higher chances for less combat power and
less chances for higher combat power.
-If the user opts no then he goes away safely
